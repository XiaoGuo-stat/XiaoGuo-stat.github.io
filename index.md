## About Me

I am currently an Associate Professor in the School of Mathematics at Northwest University, China, and I am also a member of the Center for Modern Statistics at Northwest University. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics in December 2019 from the School of Mathematics at Northwest University, advised by Prof. Hai Zhang. Before that, I received my bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Northwest University in 2013 and 2016, respectively.
